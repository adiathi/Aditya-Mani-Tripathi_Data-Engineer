Title: STEELEYE Python Engineer Assessment by Aditya Mani Tripathi

Code Overview:
The Python script is designed to process XML files and extract data from that file. It utilizes several Python libraries to perform the necessary operations. The main libraries used in the script are:

xml.etree.ElementTree: This library is used for parsing XML files and manipulating the XML tree structure.
urllib.request: This library is used for making HTTP requests and downloading files from the internet.
zipfile: This library is used for handling zip files and extracting files from them.
boto3: This library is used for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 for file operations.
pandas: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for writing data to a CSV file.
csv: This library is used for reading and writing CSV files.
logging: This library is used for logging and capturing error messages for debugging purposes.
The script consists of the following main functions:

download_xml_file(url): This function takes a download link as input and downloads the corresponding zip file from the internet. It uses the urllib.request library to make the HTTP request and download the file.
extract_xml_file(zip_file): This function takes a zip file as input and extracts the XML file from it using the zipfile library.
remove_namespace(element): This function takes an Element object as input and removes the namespace prefixes from the XML elements using the xml.etree.ElementTree library.
process_xml_file(xml_file): This function takes an XML file as input, processes it by finding the first download link with the file type as DLTINS, and downloads, extracts, and processes the data from the XML file. It uses the previously defined functions download_xml_file(), extract_xml_file(), and remove_namespace() to perform these operations.
write_to_csv(data, csv_file): This function takes a dictionary of data and a CSV file as input, and writes the data to the CSV file using the csv library.

The logging functionality also helps in capturing and reporting errors for effective debugging. Overall, this script provides a practical solution for XML file processing using Python.
